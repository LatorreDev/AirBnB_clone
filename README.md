## The console
----
The console is a Command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. It would create a new object, retrieve an object, do operations on objects, update attributes of objects and destroy an object. 

A parent class takes care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.

## How to use it?
When you see the prompt type ./console.py and press Enter.

vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~/miguel_cortes/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
